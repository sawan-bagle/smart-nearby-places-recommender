# Smart Nearby Places Recommender

A frontend application that recommends nearby places based on user mood
(work, date, quick bite, budget) using location-based filtering and
UX-driven recommendation logic.

## ✨ Features

- Mood-based place discovery
- Google Maps integration
- Distance-based sorting
- Rating-aware filtering
- Clean, glassmorphism-inspired UI
- Graceful handling of API limitations

## 🧠 How It Works

1. User selects a mood
2. App fetches nearby places using Google Places API
3. Places are enriched with distance calculation
4. Results are filtered and sorted based on mood-specific rules
5. Map and list views stay in sync

## ⚠️ Note on Google Maps API

Google Maps and Places APIs require billing to be enabled even for free-tier usage.

To avoid exposing API keys or deploying a partially functional demo, this project
is showcased via screenshots and local execution. When billing is not enabled,
the app runs in a clearly communicated preview mode.
